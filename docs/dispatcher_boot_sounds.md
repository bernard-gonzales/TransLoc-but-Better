# Dispatcher Boot Sequence Sound Suggestions

The following royalty-free sound effects can help build a "cyberpunk boot" atmosphere during the dispatcher startup sequence. Each entry includes duration details, a recommended use within the sequence, and direct links to both the Freesound details page and preview MP3 so you can quickly audition the option. All four sounds are published under the Creative Commons 0 (CC0) license, meaning they are free to use without attribution (although credit is always appreciated).

| Stage | Sound | Duration | Why it works | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BIOS POST beep | **Interface1.wav** by Eternitys | 0.078 s | Ultra-short digital chirp that mimics a synthetic POST confirmation when the dispatcher panel wakes up. | [Freesound page](https://freesound.org/people/Eternitys/sounds/141121/) · [Preview MP3](https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/141/141121_2555977-lq.mp3) |
| Subsystem spin-up | **FreakenFurby_Glitch_04.wav** by greysound | 13.261 s | Evolving glitch texture with a rising tonality—ideal under an animated boot progress bar or diagnostic scan. Trim to taste for shorter cues. | [Freesound page](https://freesound.org/s/90302/) · [Preview MP3](https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/90/90302_189568-lq.mp3) |
| Holographic interface online | **allpass glitch 19** by deadrobotmusic | 0.704 s | Sharp, airy burst that feels like a HUD element resolving into focus; layer with UI animations for extra punch. | [Freesound page](https://freesound.org/s/662719/) · [Preview MP3](https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/662/662719_11532701-lq.mp3) |
| Final systems ready stinger | **Industrial Glitch Beat** by CVLTIV8R | 4.954 s | Rhythmic cyber-industrial flourish that can cap the sequence as the dashboard becomes interactive. | [Freesound page](https://freesound.org/s/787262/) · [Preview MP3](https://cdn.freesound.org/previews/787/787262_2520418-lq.mp3) |

## Implementation tips

* Sequence the cues so the sub-100 ms beeps punctuate key UI beats, while the longer textures run quietly underneath to avoid masking the dispatcher’s spoken alerts.
* If you need seamless looping, use a short crossfade on the Industrial Glitch Beat or resample it to match the boot animation length.
* Preserve headroom (~-3 dBFS) when mastering so the dispatcher voiceover or alerts stay intelligible over the effects.
